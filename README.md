## Application Overview
Most individuals use their electrical appliances such as kettles, dishwashers, and
microwaves to perform the tasks they need to accomplish daily. Electrical appliances
such as washing machines, electric heaters and tumble-driers can be time delayed.
However, not realising that excessive electricity consumption within households is a
major problem. It is a problem financially and environmentally as we keep on using
all our electrical appliances every day to meet our needs. Hence this prevents
consumers from reusing clean electricity from renewable energy sources. It prevents
them because if electrical appliances are used simultaneously throughout
households, then demand for clean energy will not be met because unclean energy
will have to be used from non-renewable sources. 

These non-renewable sources are
unclean and emits lots of carbon dioxide which therefore leads to a spike in energy
prices as well as impacting the environment in a negative way. The main problem
that is constantly brought up is the idea of high peak consumption. We want to
increase load balancing and to decrease peak consumption instead of lowering load
balancing.

## Project Aims & Objectives
The first aim of this project is to educate households throughout Scotland about the
problem of reducing peak consumption and the different fair negotiation algorithms
that might tackle this, the individualsâ€™ hourly timeslots that they choose to run at
various hours throughout the day are negotiated against other households.
Negotiation happens through a bidding system. This bidding system allows
households to put forward several virtual credits that they wish to spend on their
chosen timeslots through multiple rounds. Households must determine how many
virtual credits they are willing to spend, however they will be left with fewer credits for
the other rounds.

Also, the aim is to educate households further about smart energy consumption.
They are going to be educated about a vital issue known as load balancing.
Potentially individuals who want to tackle climate change through various negotiation
algorithms to retrieve more clean energy from national grids by using renewable
sources more effectively. 

This way, they will be able to experiment with one fair
negotiation algorithm interactively on the web application called the First Price
Sealed Bid algorithm. Households are given several virtual credits to spend for a
given number of rounds. Individuals must figure out how they wish to spend their
credits wisely because they still need to be left with credits for the remaining rounds,
otherwise they risk losing the auction.
