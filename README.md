## Application Overview
Most individuals use their electrical appliances such as kettles, dishwashers, and
microwaves to perform the tasks they need to accomplish daily. Electrical appliances
such as washing machines, electric heaters and tumble-driers can be time delayed.
However, not realising that excessive electricity consumption within households is a
major problem. It is a problem financially and environmentally as we keep on using
all our electrical appliances every day to meet our needs. Hence this prevents
consumers from reusing clean electricity from renewable energy sources. It prevents
them because if electrical appliances are used simultaneously throughout
households, then demand for clean energy will not be met because unclean energy
will have to be used from non-renewable sources. 

These non-renewable sources are
unclean and emits lots of carbon dioxide which therefore leads to a spike in energy
prices as well as impacting the environment in a negative way. The main problem
that is constantly brought up is the idea of high peak consumption. We want to
increase load balancing and to decrease peak consumption instead of lowering load
balancing.

Once the bidding process begins, households submit a bid that represents the total
number of credits they are willing to spend for their chosen timeslot preferences. The
whole process is deemed to be anonymous because households are not going to
know other what the bids placed by other households are. Furthermore, this
algorithm involves calculating the largest bid placed between the households and at
the end of the auction, the household that places the largest bid receives the
timeslots and pays the number of virtual credits initially allocated. According to [50]
the author mentions in their literature review that for every round the individual who
initiates the auction will enter a value that represents the starting bid amount. At the
same time, the individuals will not be aware of what bid the opposing individual will
place. Thus, the whole process is anonymous. Once all the rounds have finished, the individual who is willing to spend the
largest number of credits wins the round. The maximum value is compared against
the other households. Once the auction finishes, individuals are asked to fill out a
satisfaction form that provides details on their experience with the bidding process.

Furthermore, the second aim is to promote smart clean energy consumption from
national grids in a more decentralised fashion instead of a centralised approach. A
centralised approach usually would be a utility company setting fixed prices for
everyone at different times of the day. This may not guarantee a fair distribution of
electricity consumption. Furthermore, a fair negotiation algorithm is a type of
algorithm that runs on an AI-oriented smart meter within homes. It runs at various
intervals during the day, and it would negotiate a fixed schedule with different smart
meters in other households.

## Project Aims & Objectives
The first aim of this project is to educate households throughout Scotland about the
problem of reducing peak consumption and the different fair negotiation algorithms
that might tackle this, the individualsâ€™ hourly timeslots that they choose to run at
various hours throughout the day are negotiated against other households.
Negotiation happens through a bidding system. This bidding system allows
households to put forward several virtual credits that they wish to spend on their
chosen timeslots through multiple rounds. Households must determine how many
virtual credits they are willing to spend, however they will be left with fewer credits for
the other rounds.

Also, the aim is to educate households further about smart energy consumption.
They are going to be educated about a vital issue known as load balancing.
Potentially individuals who want to tackle climate change through various negotiation
algorithms to retrieve more clean energy from national grids by using renewable
sources more effectively. 

This way, they will be able to experiment with one fair
negotiation algorithm interactively on the web application called the First Price
Sealed Bid algorithm. Households are given several virtual credits to spend for a
given number of rounds. Individuals must figure out how they wish to spend their
credits wisely because they still need to be left with credits for the remaining rounds,
otherwise they risk losing the auction.
